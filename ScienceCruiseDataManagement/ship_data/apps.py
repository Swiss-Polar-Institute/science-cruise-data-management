# This file is part of https://github.com/cpina/science-cruise-data-management
#
# This project was programmed in a hurry without any prior Django experience,
# while circumnavigating the Antarctic on the ACE expedition, without proper
# Internet access, with 150 scientists using the system and doing at the same
# cruise other data management and system administration tasks.
#
# Sadly there aren't unit tests and we didn't have time to refactor the code
# during the cruise, which is really needed.
